# Reason rover

This is an adaptation of a coding bootcamp exercise for Reason to play around with it.

First made for node / console, then wrapped in a React component.

# Build (not implemented yet)

```
npm run build
```

# Development

```
npm run dev
```

# TODO

* catch the out of bounds error in React
* bundle & minify
* different entry point for dev with `require` than for built?
* keyboard handling
